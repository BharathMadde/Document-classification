## üîç Extraction Methods

### Text-Based Documents
- **Plain Text (.txt)**: Direct file reading (100% confidence)
- **PDF**: Text extraction with OCR fallback (90% confidence)
- **Word Documents (.docx/.doc)**: Mammoth.js with OCR fallback (90% confidence)

### Image-Based Documents
- **OCR (Tesseract.js)**: Primary method for images (80% confidence)
- **Gemini Vision API**: AI-powered fallback for unclear images (80% confidence)

### Confidence Levels
- **High (0.8-1.0)**: Reliable extraction, proceed with classification
- **Medium (0.5-0.7)**: Limited confidence, may need review
- **Low (0.0-0.4)**: Poor extraction, route to human intervention

## üö¶ Workflow Process

1. **Upload**: Document uploaded and validated
2. **Extraction**: Text extracted using appropriate method(s)
3. **Classification**: Document classified based on content
4. **Routing**: Document routed to appropriate destination
5. **Fallback**: Human intervention for unclear documents

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3000)
- `BACKEND_URL`: Backend URL for internal calls (default: http://localhost:3000)

### Dependencies
- **OCR**: Tesseract.js for image processing
- **PDF**: pdf-parse for PDF text extraction
- **Word**: Mammoth.js for Word document processing
